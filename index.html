		<h1>Twisted Ridaz MC</h1>	
		
		<p>Twisted Ridaz is a family oriented riding club who prides itself on having quality riders who not only have the passion for two wheels, but are willing to mentor, teach, and guide newer riders. We believe in having quality ridaz not quantity. What started out as a thought has quickly spiraled into one of the most recognized "upcoming" clubs within the JC and Manhattan sport bike community. Twisted Ridaz also supports any and all clubs within the area and will be busy within the community. If you have two wheels and you enjoy riding and are looking to be apart of a family, then you have a couple of options...you can contact us via Facebook, phone, or email, or you can try contacting us when you see us around. Either way, all riders are more than welcome to come out with us.</p>
